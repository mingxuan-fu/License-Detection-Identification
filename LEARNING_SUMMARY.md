# Learning Summary

I have chosen the coding approach and learning path for this project. which consisted of:

1. 'Use visual tools to create machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning': in which I learnt how to use the various tools provided in Azure Machine Learning workspace to perform regression, classification and clustering using various model or fully automated machine learning. All of which is done in a simple to use drag and drop manner, with minimum to no coding.

2. 'Scale AI in your organization': which introduced the business and management aspect of introducing Machine learning within a organisation, such as MLOps, AI related roles, etc.

3. 'Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks': which introduced some machine learning models and techniques performed via python, reiterating regression and other more complex models.

4. 'Build real world applications with Python': Which introduced some basic python programming principles, some OOP principles and concepts, and usage of Python with Azure Cognitive Services. Unfortunately I have chosen Node.js as the environment of choice for this project, somewhat limiting the use of this learning path, though it is still very useful for future projects and to generally improve my Python skill.
