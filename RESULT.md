Ultimately, the license detection part of this project performs suprisingly well, it is able to recognise and select the license plate in most test images with a great deal of accuracy and precision It only falls short in sometimes not selecting the entire license plate, only part of it, This can however be rectified through a manual expansion of the selection box through code to increase the probability that the entire license plate will be bounded by the selection box. This model can be improved in the future with more data and more iterations of training.

However, the identification part of the project through the use of Azure Computer Vision's OCR capability works less than stellarly. While I did not realise this before starting significant work on this project, Azure Custom Vision OCR is mainly designed for use with images of structured text data, such as sentences, words and paragraphs, and it is not designed for largely random alphanumeric strings such as those present on License plates. This has resulted in a incredibly poor rate of any identification of the license plate by the API, and rarely if any cases of it being perfectly correct. In addition, as Azure Computer Vision is a entirely pre-built model, it is impossible to modifiy it to better suit the need of this project. It is recommended to migrate over to a entirely custom OCR model or a model designed specifically for license plates and other text data consisting of random alphanumeric strings to improve this aspect of the project.
